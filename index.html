								<h2 class="major">Project One</h2>
								<p>ENGR 11A is an introductory engineering course in which I explored a number of foundational concepts. This article focuses specifically on my work in 3D printing, particularly Project One, which introduced me to the use of a 3D printer, 3D printing software, and the process of creating prototypes. Before detailing each part of the project, I will briefly explain the overall process for simplicity sake, and to avoid repetition later on..
									 </p>To create a prototype, I first downloaded a design file to my laptop and uploaded it to PrusaSlicer, the software used to customize the prototype. Within PrusaSlicer, I customized the appearance of the design to achieve my desired product. Once satisfied, I sliced the file and saved it to a USB drive, which was then inserted into the Prusa Mini+ to begin printing. Before the actual print could start, calibration tests were required to ensure the X, Y, and Z coordinates were correctly aligned, the temperature was set appropriately for PLA filament, and the filament was extruding properly all of which ensured the final product came out with acceptable quality With these steps completed, the prototype was ready to print, allowing me to watch the magic happen.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Part One: Nametag</h2>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_0021.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In Part One of this project, I learned how to use a 3D printer along with the software necessary to create a simple object. I began with a nametag, shown above. This process proved to be  challenging yet rewarding. While I am open to learning new skills, this was one of the more complex things  I have learned. Nonetheless, I successfully completed this part and am eager to discuss my experience. Before working with the printer, I downloaded a program called PrusaSlicer, which connects to the Prusa Mini+ 3D Printer. After installing the software, I imported the <a href="http://brandeis.app.box.com/v/prusaminifiles">nametag 3MF file</a> into PrusaSlicer. This allowed me to view and customize my prototype. While the basic setup was straightforward, customization was a bit harder than I was expecting as I was unable to change colors as I wanted to originally. I initially planned to print the nametag in multiple colors but ultimately produced a solid-colored design. PrusaSlicer includes a feature called “Color Change” which enables users to change filament colors mid-print to achieve a multicolored product. At the time, I did not realize that activating this feature requires clicking the small plus icon within the software. I printed the nametag at least three times before moving on, however this experience helped me better understand the software so I could improve on the next part. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Part Two: Torture Test</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/x-mas duck.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Of the entire project, this was my favorite part. This section of the project was where I learned to stress the machine in order to see how well it worked. I wanted to create something cute and fitting to my personality but also challenge myself to figure out how to get this color change. And as seen in the picture above, I was pretty successful! To begin, I searched for a  prototype to download as an STL file. I absolutely loved the number of cute things I could have made including a mini zombie, frankenstein, snowman, etc. But ultimately I decided to create a little duck with a X-mas hat which would allow me to practice my skills in color changing while also staying within the parameters of this project. Through this process, I learned how to properly remove the existing filament and insert a new color to achieve my project the way I liked. It is worth noting that this print took me two tries. My first attempt failed because I did not realize that a knot in the filament roll would prevent the machine from feeding the PLA filament properly, causing the print to stop midway. After resolving this issue, my second attempt was successful, and I was able to produce my little duck to my liking! </p>

								<h2 class="major">Part Three: OSAD</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the final section of this project, I had a stronger understanding of both the PrusaSlicer software and the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer which made this section much easier. For this part, I created an assistive item for everyday use, a touchpad for a laptop. The same rules applied to this part as well. I first opened the file on Prusa Slicer, to which I customized the touchpad to my liking. After this, I spliced it and saved it on my USB drive. The next step was to input the USB into the machine, allowing to to begin printing. The printing process itself felt more straightforward than in earlier stages, as I had already gained experience producing several prototypes, and utilized the process of failure in order to learn. However, I was unable to fully complete the touchpad due to timing constraints and the missing the top component needed for it to function properly. Despite that, this stage was the "simplest" part of the project for me because I was able to draw directly on the skills and knowledge gained from previous sections. I particularly enjoyed applying what I had learned to design something practical, and reflecting on how I found, this time round, the process was smoother reflected the growth in my confidence and capability with 3D printing technology. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Two </h2>
								<span class="image main">  </span>
								<p>This project consisted of 4 main parts: an introduction to two platforms in which I could create a 3D model, sketching and designing my model, using each platform individually to remix this model, and reflecting on the process as I went along. These platforms were called Tinkercad and Autodesk Fusion. In this write up, you will find my reflections on how I viewed these platforms but for now, a brief introduction to this project. The purpose of this project was to advance my knowledge in 3D printing as well as familiarize myself with the designing process. This was a chance for me to implement what I had learned about Human Centered Design, and apply it to myself (as the person kept at the center of my design process). As such, I paid attention to things that I would need and how I could go about designing it to fit said needs. I decided to create a picture frame (a) because I need one and (b) to see how challenging it would be to design. I knew I didn't want corner pieces, as it would ruin the look of the design I wanted, but also knew that I needed to create a snap & fit frame for easy assembly. Keeping these things in mind, I began sketching out my design. After my sketch was finished, I began digitally creating this model in Tinkercad. <p/> 
								</article>

							<article id="project2">
								<h2 class="major">Learning Process </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LearningProcess.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"> </span>
								<p>During the learning process of both platforms, I learned how to create a 3D model. I decided to create a Monogrammed Ring which is just a ring with my initials on it. With this ring, I was able to create it in Tinkercad with the ring 3D shape and the basic letters that were provided. I quite enjoyed this process as I was able to see my vision come to life with how I wanted my name printed on my ring (the spacing, the sizing, shape, etc). However, as I moved on to Fusion I had a harder time with it because I wasn’t able to get my surface to look the way I wanted to. If you look above at the side by side pictures, you can see how in Tinkercad (on the right), my ring looks polished and with a nicer finish whereas in Fusion (on the left), you can see all the geometric aspects to it. Trying to get rid of the geometric triangles proved to be a challenge as the video made it seem easier. Maybe it’s not too hard of a process, but that’s a process I will try again another time. Other than that, this ring was a great way to introduce me to the intricacies of both platforms.  </p>

							<article id="project2">
								<h2 class="major">TinkerCad </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Sketch and Image .png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Like I mentioned before, I wanted to make a picture frame for my design because I found it to be a simple enough project that I knew I could create, but would also challenge me on figuring out how to connect the pieces together. I do love a challenge, and learning how to measure the snap fit pieces was truly a challenge but it's the part I enjoyed most. In this section of the project, I took the sketch I had made and "transferred" it to Tinkercad.  (The image of my finished product in Tinkercad). Using Tinkercad was an enjoyable experience because I was able to take basic 3D shapes and transform them into parts that I could put together for this print. I took the basic box shape and extended it to make a rectangular shape, then took the semi circle shape and attached it to one end of the rectangle. Finally, I took the same shape and made it a hole in order to make for a shape that would allow me to connect the two pieces. The most difficult part was shaping each of the “holes” the correct size to fit all the pieces together. My size for the hole was 10 mm in width, 7 mm in height, and 13 in length. This would fit my 9.8mm widthm 6.8 mm height, and 12.9 length insert piece. Other than measurements, the only other part I found quite challenging was centering each piece to ensure that my frame would come out evenly. It's a bit difficult to see in the image, but the pieces fit ok with each other but definitely could use some improvement. </p>
								<p> For this frame, I used standard PLA filament at 210 °C with a 60 °C heated bed. I kept supports off because the geometry of my pieces didn’t require them, at first. As I went to print them, I ran into some issues becuase the printer was not able to print layer by layer since the model was not laid correctly. While editing my model in Prusa Slicer, I realized that supports would be needed, though I did not add them for the sake of my snap fit pieces being able to connect with each other. These settings produced a clean print, though the tolerance between my snap fit pieces could still be tightened or loosened depending on future testing. As I went along in this process, I realized that editing in Tinkercad does not transfer equally to Prusa Slicer. I needed to edit how it would print in Prusa Slicer itself. It sounds obvious now but at the time I was confused as to why my print kept messing up. It's also important to note that all calibration processes in Prusa Slicer and Prusa Mini + are the same as in Project One. Every design was saved as an .STL file and imported into Prusa Slicer to be sliced and exported for print. This project allowed me to use the final product, and feel a sense of accomplishment not only because I could hang it up on my wall, but because I made it myself.</p>

								<article id="project2">
									<h2 class="major">Fusion </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sketch only .png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></p>Once I was done with Tinkercad, I took the same design and moved it to Autodesk Fusion. Now, while I may love a challenge, Fusion was more annoying than I thought it would be. Learning how to remix 3D designs in Fusion was not as simple as it sounded in the tutorials (which only made me appreciate Tinkercad more). However, I still managed to get it done. The same process applied to this section as well except I took the .STL file saved from Tinkercad and imported it to Fusion. From there I modified the mesh body it was imported as  into a designable CAD file. Once I could remix it as a CAD file, I removed any and all faces that were unnecessary for the design. I then made some small edits until I was satisfied with the final look. The challenge began with learning how the program worked but the hardest part was making sure the measurements were the same as they were in the Tinkercad file.</p>
								<p>Once I was satisfied with my finished product, I saved it in Fusion and began the process of printing. Again, the calibration processes in Prusa Slicer and on the Prusa Mini+ are the same as in Project One. Every design was saved as an .STL file and imported into Prusa Slicer to be sliced and exported for print. For this print I used the same PLA filament at 210 °C with a 60 °C bed temperature. Supports were  left off as a trial to see if my model could print without them, but adding supports would have been helpful. With that said though, if I added supports, my snap fit pieces may not have worked, so it was more of a judgement call.  These settings allowed the Fusion modified model to print accurately, but tolerances around the snap fit still need improvement.</p>
								<p>Moving my design to Fusion allowed me to refine parts that were harder to adjust in Tinkercad. However, I learned that maintaining consistent measurements across software is essential for getting a good print. This was a “hard lession” because I didnt have the same measurements when I made this model again in Fusion. I had to measure in mm what I had originally put in Tinkercad, and then redo my pieces in Fusion. In the future, I would optimize my design further by checking dimensional accuracy between Fusion and Tinkercad before slicing, experimenting with slightly tighter or looser tolerances to improve snap-fit assembly.</p>

								<p>After reading the instructions on how to assemble this radio, it sounds pretty straightforward. I am a bit confused about the diagrams and what they are trying to show, but I’m sure I can figure that out since I am working with a partner.  I do think there will be some confusion on circuitry and how it will come together. Also, because this is my first time soldering I do expect there to be a learning process to it. I am a pretty fast learner and I enjoyed the training for soldering on the practice piece, so I do think that I will get better as I continue making the radio. </p>

								<p>The process of meausrements was a bit tiresome but fun at the same time because it required me to be real precise with MINIMAL room for error otherwise the components wouldn't fit on my pencil. However, I managed to get all the measurements, and with some trial and error, they fit snug on my pencil.</p>

								<p> This is the first prototype I made of my design. This prototype is unfinished as there is not top part (as in the spherical top). However this provided me with a lot of useful information on my measurements. Luckily, the measurements fit on my pencil the first time. The slot in the pencil cap fit around the metal charging piece on the pencil itself, and the magnet fit very tighly in the hole for it</p>

While walking down to the Rose Arts Museum, we saw this long bendy pathway and I began skipping (mainly becuase I was in a good mood that day) but an idea sparked where we realized that children have such amazing imaginations. Anywhere becomes a place of fun for them and so we took this picture! </p>

								<p>My group and I went inside the theatre and met a guy workking there. We decided to ask him a few questions about production and how the room was oriented. To our surprise, the employee areas were extremely inaccessible. We weren't surpised that they could not be accessed by people who don't work there, however, those that did had to be skinny and fit, to be blunt. There were so many physical barriers that weren't meant for prevention, but rather barriers that made the room inaccessible. For example, to those who work on the lighting for the stage, they have to manually climb up to that area, squeeze themselves in that narrow area just to fix lighting. </p>
								<p>This image, though, was the physical barrier of the stage curtains. It too has to be manually moved. A: this is a physical barrier in and of itself to keep the audience away from back stage but B: this is also a physical barrier as it is not easy for the stage producers/production team to climb up to the top to remove the curtain from where it originally was to wherever they want it to be</p>
